// console.log("Victor's Drum Kit JS30 challenge!");
// We are making a javascript drumkit that responds to keyboard keys when pressed by a human.
// By 'responds' we mean produce sound, just like real drums!
// keycode.info gives a number associated with key pressed, works with most keys and with most languages but it aint perfect
// 1.Firstly we need to listen for keydown event
// What is window?
// The window object represents the browser's window.
// The window object represents an open window in a browser.
// funtion(e) -> `e` stands for an event
//
window.addEventListener("keydown", function (e) {
  console.log(e);
});
